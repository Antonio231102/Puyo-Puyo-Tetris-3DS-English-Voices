## Installation:

**Luma3DS v7.0 and up:**

- Go to "sound" folder inside "English Voices" folder and extract the BCSAR file in the same directory (it was compressed and splitted in two parts due to GitHub's limitation of 25MB per file); finally just delete the RAR files.

- Rename the "English Voices" folder to "romfs" and move it to "\luma\titles\0004000000101200\\".

- Enable the "Enable game patching" option in the Luma3DS configuration.

**Build as a CIA:**

- Dump your copy of the game (physical or digital) and extract the files.

- Copy the "sound" folder inside "English Voices" folder and merge it with the extracted RomFS.

- Rebuild as a CIA and install.

**Compatible with HANS**
